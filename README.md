# Camera-Calibration
## RBE549: [Computer Vision](https://pear.wpi.edu/teaching/rbe549/spring2025.html) - [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/), Spring 2025
This project is an implementation from scratch of the well-known research paper ['A Flexible New Technique for Camera Calibration'](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr98-71.pdf) by Zhengyou Zhang as part of a course project for the RBE 549: Computer Vision course, at WPI. Details of the project can be found [here](https://rbe549.github.io/spring2025/hw/hw1/).
The aim lies in inestimating the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera using a checkerboard pattern for calibration. It involves capturing images of a checkerboard, detecting corners, estimating initial parameters, and refining these estimates through non-linear optimization.
For a detailed explanation of the approach, methodology, and results, please refer to the [Report](https://github.com/AdiManav2102/Camera_Calibration/blob/master/Report.pdf) included in this repository.
